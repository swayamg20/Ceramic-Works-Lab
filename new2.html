Why did we name our lab <b>"CeramicWorks"</b>? <br><br> From an early age, Diwali was the most awaited festival for me. Light, color, food, festival and fireworks. 
When I saw the fireworks in US on the occasion of 4th July (Independance Day), I was mesmerized: what patterns! what precision in timing! A science of alchemy which
 was nothing short of magic. The bright colors in the dark sky, manifesting joy, exuberance, and celebration. In our research, we want to achieve the technological excellence 
 with synthesis and processing of novel materials that will capture our imagination of a vibrant future.</p>
<p align="justify">Ceramics is that material with infinite possibilities. Ceramics exhibit wide range of properties, because of their ability to form 
ionic and covalent bonds and configure themselves in varieties of crystal structures. And that's where their strength lie: they are everywhere -

super-capacitors), fuel-cells, refractories, bio-ceramics, electronics, jewelries, … you name it!

			Any reliable technology stands on sound scientific foundation. Being an academic research lab, scientific understanding comes first. Our

			Crystal structure and processing technique determine the final properties of materials. But as learn from Ashby's Material selection Maps, there

			A very simple example of a composite, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"> human bones </a>, is a composite of hard mineralized tissue (cortical) and soft 
			organic elastic fibers (collagen). The hardened matrix, formed by Calcium Hydroxylapatite, grows into  an open-lattice structure that allows 
			blood vessels. This unique design and composition allows bones to be hard and fracture resistant while being light-weight. Additionally, it is 
			also functionally graded material with hard cortical bones on the surface and spongy Trabecular bone inside. An idea that has been adopted in TMT (
			Thermo Mechanically Treated) steel bars, used to reinforce concrete (another example of popular composite). We design the structure of composites 
			made up of metal-ceramic-polymers for <a href="Armor"> armor</a>, functionally graded materials, <a href="#TBC"> thermal barrier coating </a> and shock absorption applications.

			of human civilization. However, the process has changed little until a few decades ago when our scientific understanding

			During the Pandemic, we realized the big chasm between theories being taught in the classes and technologies being developed. With all scientific prowess
			we struggled to save lives. There were urgent need for PPE kits, Ventilators, Oxygen concentrators, vaccines. I was involved in two of these projects: 
			<a href="https://www.pipeskit.org/"> PPE Kits </a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6850721289439592449/"> Oxygen concentrator</a>.
			The working principle of an oxygen concentrator is rather simple: zeolite under high pressure selectively absorps Nitrogen on its surface. All one needs to do is to have two 
			vessels containing Zeolite and use pressure swing adsorption (PSA) with the help of timed solenoid valves get pure oxygen from one vessel while the other one gets purged. 
			This process reverses in the second half of the cycle and it continues. 
			<br>
			 <p align="justify"><img src="assets/img/research/OC2.jpg" alt="firework" class="imgfixone" style="width:350px!important;">
			Transforming this principle into technology turned out to be a challengin task, but with the help of IIT community, specially our technical staffs at IITK: Vijay Yadav, 
			Om Prakash, Anil Jha and our own alumni from RevRefineries, we were able to achieve 90-93% pure oxygen at the flow rate of 10 LPM (Litre per minute). I am
			sharing a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6850721289439592449/"> post </a> of Startup Innovation and Incubation center at

			The power efficiency of a turbine engine and jet engine is limited by the temperature these structures could withstand without softening. 
			Depending on the application, operation temperatures can exceed 700 ºC. Beyond these temperatures, refractory metal-alloys start 
			oxidizing and softening, resulting in quick degradation. Ceramics, on the other hand, are resistant to oxidation, corrosion and wear, as well as withstand 
			very higher temperatures. However, they are brittle in nature and can undergo catastrophic failure without warning. So, naturally a composite materials are developed in which 
			the high temperature Ni-super alloys are coated with a thin layer of ceramics, called <b> thermal barrier coating, TBC</b><a href="https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/45152 "> 
			(relevant article)</a>.This coating serves two purposes: it protects them from oxidation, and it can sustain an appreciable temperature gradient across a relatively thin 
			layer of ceramic (100 μm to 2 mm) which allows the engine to operate at a much higher temperature, thus achieving a higher efficiency as per the Carnot cycle. <br><br>
			
			While the idea of TBC is simple, processing isn't. And that is because of the processing temperatures for metals and ceramics are different
			and the wettibility of ceramics on metals is poor, meaning they don't want to stick to each other and result in poor interfacial strength. With microwaves (electromagnetic fields), 
			electric fields and magnetic fields we have seen improved interfaces and mechanical adherence and some unexpected results. <br>

			Taking a leaf out of Nature's design handbook, the research group Prof. Ortiz (MIT) and her collaborators have used the idea of 
			Exoskeletons of insects, shells of invertebrates, and scales of fishes to conceptualize flexible Bio-ceramic armors. In a ground breaking

			mimicked Chiton's scaled exterior mineralized scales arrayed on the soft underlying layer. The inter scale spacing was design to give flexibility for 
			easy manoeuvring. We are developing composites of metal-ceramics-polymers to develop shock absorbing designs.

			While factories and laboratories are essential for Technological advances, they also generate various toxic gases like NO2, CO, and Volatile Oxide
			Components (VOCs such as acetone and ethanol) pose a serious threat to our health and wellbeing. This situation has compelled us to think of sensors
			that can monitor the presence of such gases in real-time. While some sensors are already in use, we need to develop novel synthesis routes and
			new sensing materials, which can be then integrated together to achieve high accuracy and precision.
			Metal oxide semiconductors (MOS) in nanostructure form have the potential of becoming a compelling alternative to existing
			sensors owing to their high surface-to-volume ratio, high sensitivity towards toxic gases, and ease of synthesis, while being economically
			viable. We work on Hydrothermally grown oxides and doped oxides to improve their sensing properties based on morphological changes.

			Any reliable technology stands on sound scientific foundation. Being an academic research lab, scientific understanding comes first. Our
			research group focuses on three major field of researchs: Composites, Field assisted processing, and Machine learning. While appearing disconnected
			at first sight, they are pieces of the same jigsaw puzzle, commonly known as <a href="https://msestudent.com/what-is-materials-science-tetrahedron-paradigm/"> 
			<b>"Material's Tetrahedron"</b></a>. This tetrahedron emphasizes on four 
			independant pillars in developing technologies that we can depend on: <b> Structure, Processing, Properties and Performance.</b> <br> <br>
			
			Crystal structure and processing technique determine the final properties of materials. But as learn from Ashby's Material selection Maps, there 
			are always trade-off in properties. For example, hard materials have limited ductility. To overcome this natural 
			challenge, we design <b> <a href="composites">composites </a></b>of complementary materials and take advantage of <b><a href="processing"> field assisted processing </a></b> to achieve desired 
			performance. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk"> <b>Machine Leaning </b></a> and <b>FEM (finite element method, </b> 
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHjopp47vvQ&t=415s">YouTube Video</a>) are used as tools to understand and simulate the corelations among the corners of the

			<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9781856176637/materials-selection-in-mechanical-design"> Ashby’s maps </a> highlights the need for composite designs where materials of different properties (often contrasting) are stitched together to provide
			superior properties. Properties that no single material exhibit, kind of Meta-material. Nature, being the greatest designer/architecture has done 
			it over and over again, giving rise to a new field of study "Bio-inspired designs." <br><br>
			
			A very simple example of a composite, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"> human bones </a>, is a composite of hard mineralized tissue (cortical) and soft 
			organic elastic fibers (collagen). The hardened matrix, formed by Calcium Hydroxylapatite, grows into  an open-lattice structure that allows 
			blood vessels. This unique design and composition allows bones to be hard and fracture resistant while being light-weight. Additionally, it is 
			also functionally graded material with hard cortical bones on the surface and spongy Trabecular bone inside. An idea that has been adopted in TMT (
			Thermo Mechanically Treated) steel bars, used to reinforce concrete (another example of popular composite). We design the structure of composites 
			made up of metal-ceramic-polymers for <a href="Armor"> armor</a>, functionally graded materials, <a href="#TBC"> thermal barrier coating </a> and shock absorption applications.

			<p align="justify">Ceramic parts are primarily fabricated by sintering. Sintering is a process in which powders of desired material are
			first compacted into desired shape and then fired to a high temperature. High temperature facilitates the diffusion 
			of constituent particles into a solid dense mass. Sintering, in the form of pottery, is one of the oldest invention 
			of human civilization. However, the process has changed little until a few decades ago when our scientific understanding
			of sintering mechanisms improved. Researcher showed that pressure, rapid heating and microwave heating can not only 
			shorten the processing time but also improved the properties of fabricated material. The field assisted sintering (also known 
			as <b> Flash Sintering</b>) is the latest addition to the list, in which we apply electric field directly to the ceramics (at relatively 
			lower furnace temperature). 		<br><br>

			For a typical case of 3 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia, as we move from convention sintering to pressure assisted (hot press), Microwave (MW),
			Spark plasma sintering (SPS) to flash sintering, the sintering temperature dropped from 1500 C to 800 C. The right most figure shows that as we apply 
			higher and higher electric field (DC voltage)the sintering temperature drops and densification rate enhances.
